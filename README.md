# Real-Time Monitoring System for Sewage Workers

## Overview

Sewage workers are often exposed to hazardous gases and harsh environmental conditions, posing significant risks to their health and safety. Current monitoring methods are inadequate, relying heavily on manual checks that are both time-consuming and susceptible to human error. This project introduces a wearable device designed to continuously monitor gas levels and the physiological health of sewage workers in real-time. By using advanced sensors and communication protocols, the system aims to enhance safety measures by providing immediate alerts and sending critical data to a central gateway for further processing and analysis.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously tracks environmental and physiological factors using wearable sensors.
- **Immediate Alerts**: Detects hazardous conditions and sends instant alerts to workers, allowing them to take necessary precautions.
- **Data Communication**: Sends collected data to a central gateway through a secure communication protocol.
- **Cloud Integration**: Processes and stores data in the cloud for long-term analysis and pattern identification.
- **Health Data Reporting**: Automatically sends worker health data to the nearest medical center in case of emergencies.

## Technologies Used

- **Wearable Sensors**: For detecting gas levels and monitoring physiological data.
- **Communication Protocols**: For secure and reliable data transmission between devices and the central gateway.
- **Central Gateway**: Collects data from various sensors and transmits it to the cloud.
- **Cloud Services**: For storing, processing, and analyzing data to improve safety protocols.
- **Alert System**: Provides real-time notifications to workers and supervisors in case of hazardous conditions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Set up the Environment:**

   Ensure all necessary libraries and dependencies are installed:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure the Gateway:**

   Set up the central gateway by following the instructions in the `gateway_setup.md` file.

4. **Deploy the Wearable Device:**

   Follow the steps in the `device_setup.md` file to configure and deploy the wearable sensors on the workers.

## Usage

1. **Start the Gateway:**

   Begin by running the central gateway application:

   ```bash
   python gateway.py
   ```

2. **Activate the Wearable Devices:**

   Power on the wearable sensors, which will automatically connect to the gateway.

3. **Monitor and Analyze:**

   Use the provided dashboard interface to monitor real-time data and receive alerts.

4. **Emergency Response:**

   The system will automatically send health data to the nearest medical center if any critical conditions are detected.

## Code Structure

- **`wearable_device.py`**: Manages data collection and transmission from wearable sensors.
- **`gateway.py`**: Centralizes data collection, processing, and communication with the cloud.
- **`cloud_services.py`**: Handles data storage, processing, and analysis in the cloud.
- **`alert_system.py`**: Responsible for sending real-time alerts to workers and supervisors.

## Key Concepts

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Provides continuous and instant data on environmental and physiological factors.
- **Cloud Integration**: Ensures data is securely stored and analyzed to improve safety protocols over time.
- **Wearable Technology**: Enhances worker safety by providing immediate feedback and alerts.
